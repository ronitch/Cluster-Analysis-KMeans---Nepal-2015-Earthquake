# Cluster-Analysis-KMeans---Nepal-2015-Earthquake

KMeans cluster analysis has been performed on the dataset.

In April of 2015 the 7.8 magnitude Gorkha earthquake occured near the Gorkha district of Gandaki Pradesh, Nepal. Almost 9,000 lives were lost, millions of people were instantly made homeless, and $10 billion in damages––about half of Nepal's nominal GDP––were incurred. In the years since, the Nepalese government has worked intensely to help rebuild the affected districts' infrastructures. Throughout this process, the National Planning Commission, along with Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, has generated one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

The aim of this analysis is to find out which districts of Nepal have been the most severely affected and should get the most Disaster Aid.
